registration identifier

move on grid
detect color of panel
paint panel black or white (all black at start)

intcode inputs
0 - over black
1 - over white

output: 
color to paint (0 black, 1 white)
direction to turn: 0 left, 1 right
when turned it moves one panel.
starts facing up

need to know the number of unique panels painted (regardless of color)

plan:
have vector representing painted co-ords relative to starting point
have function which, given co-ords, looks up color
feed that into computer, collect two values - paint color and turn dir
use those values to update the vector (adding new co-ord and color)
(will need to keep track of the direction of the robot)
count the set of the final vector.

functions
run-robot
lookup-color
update-surface

GRAVITY SIM
position is [x y z]
velocity is [vx vy vz]

algo is:
* update velocity vector of each body for gravity
* apply velocity vector to position

gravity application:
for each body A calc the impact of each other body B on it:
* compare x pos. If Ax > Bx, dec Avx, if Ax < Bx, inc Avx. if Ax = Bx, Avx doesn't change
* repeat for y and z
* repeat for each body

data-structure:
* for each body, {:pos [x y z] :vel [vx vy vz]}
* a time step is represented as a vector of these
* history is represented as a vector of these, where the time-step at position n etc. Don't know if this is actually needed, probably don't need to decide yet.

functions:
* update-position: given a body, apply the velocity to the position to derive the new pos
* update-velocities: given a vector of bodies, update the velocity of each based on their relative positions
* total-energy: just sum up all the absolute values
